    <li id="i2"> Linux Runs NASA</li>
    <p id="i3">You read this title correctly. The world organization responsible for naming the numerous stars and planets around us has a strong faith in Linux. They are using the open-source approach to sell the world to open-faith to prepare ourselves for the likelihood of making contact with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Since NASA uses Pleiades supercomputers, this statement should be enough proof of the performance metrics a Linux OS has to offer.
     These supercomputers embrace the open-source nature of Linux OS as their primary software to exploit and re-discover our solar system and galaxy. NASA switched from Windows to Linux years ago because of the favored performance reliability the Linux system offered. The recent deployment of the Astrobee robots to monitor and work under an International Space Station is proof enough that with Linux, the sky is not the limit.</p>
<li id="i2">Linux Runs eReader</li>
<p id="i3">if you are currently digesting this article piece word by word, you value reading as much as breathing. Life somehow feels incomplete without digesting some interesting article piece daily. Amazon paid close attention to earthlings’ desire to consume interesting reading materials and created the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite. Linux runs the one place where you can store, archive, or bookmark thousands of your favorite reading material.

    There is more to it though, Amazon’s services like Amazon EC2 and Fire TV are under the spell of Linux. Interacting with Alexa is indirectly interacting with a Linux system. Therefore, when you fetch your favorite sports team’s scoreboard or ask for the time via Alexa, an android-based Linux OS called Fire OS, with a Linux base, is responsible for the results you receive. It is a fact that when Google was developing Android, they were after a Linux OS that would cater to all mobile handsets. Android currently powers 76% of smartphones.</p>
    <li id="i2"> Linux Runs TV</li>
    <p id="i3">The TiVo open-source entertainment platform for digital recording is Linux-based. The entertainment list does not end here. The simplified streaming capabilities of Roku devices, sourced from the Roku OS, qualifies its software as a customized Linux version. Video streaming through Chromecast has the digital footprints of a Linux Operating System. Apart from the streaming devices and set-top boxes, the power of Linux might also be hidden in your smart TV.

        The webOS that breathes life to LG devices has a strong relationship with the Linux kernel. Devices designed and developed by brands like Phillips and Samsung also employ aspects of the Linux OS.</p>
        <li id="i2">Linux Runs Smartwatches and laptops</li>
        <p id="i3">The smartwatch’s bragging rights currently possess a high possibility of operating under a Linux OS. The worldwide school systems’ education-empowerment crusade has been embracing one-to-one systems implementations to ensure that every child on earth can access an individual laptop to meet their learning needs.

            Most of the institutions propelling this crusade are taking the Chromebook approach. The Chrome OS that powers these resourceful and lightweight laptops got its inspiration from Linux; hence it has most of its borrowed parts under its design and development architecture.</p>
            <li id="i2"> Linux Runs Cars</li>
            <p id="i3">Most cars run on fuel, but smart car manufacturers that are after conquering the automobile industry’s innovative landscapes like Volkswagen, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and Mazda are considering Automotive Grade Linux in their car manufacturing projects. It is a standard code base that wants to take over the automobile industry. The in-vehicle infotainment system installed on your car is also likely siphoning some Linux privileges. The non-profit automotive industry alliance, Genivi Alliance, is also standardizing the integration of vehicles cockpit’s middleware with a scalable OS. We can only guess the type of operating system they are implying.</p>
            <li id="i2"> Linux Runs Gaming Platforms</li>
            <p id="i3">Every dedicated gamer or gaming enthusiast under the Linux platform is familiar with SteamOS. It is the go-to gaming platform powered by Linux for individuals that want to keep their gaming experience on their favorite OS, Linux. Apart from SteamOS, the control you get from Google’s myriad of services is because of the power of Linux.</p>
            <li id="i2">Linux Runs Social Media</li>
            <p id="i3">Your day-to-day login and apps interactions like scrolling, commenting, and liking on your favorite social media app might seem like a light load to a server hosting these sites or apps. When millions of users are online, it is a different story. It only takes an OS with scalable and stable performance metrics to contain and maintain the user experience of such user databases. Then you should not be surprised that Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook are all embracing the digital footprints of Linux.</p>
            
            <h1 id="i1">Advantages of Linux</h1>
    <li id="i2">Open Source</li>
    <p id="i3">One of the main advantages of Linux is that it is an
         open source operating system i.e. its source code is easily available for
         everyone. Anyone capable of coding can contribute, modify, 
        enhance and distribute the code to anyone and for any purpose.</p>
        
             <li id="i2">Security</li>
              <p id="i3" >  Linux is more secure in comparison to other operating systems such as Windows.
                  Linux is not completely secure as there is some malware for it also but it is less
                   vulnerable than others. Every program in Linux whether an application or a virus needs
                    authorization from the administrator in the form of a password. Unless the password is
                     typed virus won’t execute.
                  There is no requirement of any anti-virus program in Linux.</p>
                  <li id="i2">Revive older computer systems</li>
                  <p id="i3">Linux helps you to use or utilize your old and outdated computer
                       systems as a firewall, router, backup server or file server and many more.
                        There are many distributions available to use according to your system 
                        capability.
