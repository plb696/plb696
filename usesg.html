    <li id="i2">Open Source</li>
    <p id="i3">One of the main advantages of Linux is that it is an
         open source operating system i.e. its source code is easily available for
         everyone. Anyone capable of coding can contribute, modify, 
        enhance and distribute the code to anyone and for any purpose.</p>
        One of the main advantages of Linux is that it is an open 
            source operating system i.e. its source code is easily available for everyone.

             <li id="i2">Security</li>
              <p id="i3" >  Linux is more secure in comparison to other operating systems such as Windows.
                  Linux is not completely secure as there is some malware for it also but it is less
                   vulnerable than others. Every program in Linux whether an application or a virus needs
                    authorization from the administrator in the form of a password. Unless the password is
                     typed virus won’t execute.

                           software updates. These software updates are much faster 
                           than updates in any other operating system. Updates in Linux
                            can be done easily without facing any major issue or concern.</p>
                            <li id="i2">Customization</li>
